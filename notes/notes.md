# About the Evergreen Notetaking Method

So you're probably wondering, Anakin, what are Evergreen notes? Evergreen Notes are a style of notetaking developed by Andy Matsuchak that encouages better on-going notetaking, much like "digital" gardening. That's the gist of it.

If you're curious for more information, I would encourage you to [read a sample of Andy's Notes firsthand](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes). 

I also use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to write.
