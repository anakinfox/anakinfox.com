# About the Evergreen Notetaking Method

So you're probably wondering, Anakin, what are Evergreen notes? Evergreen Notes are a style of notetaking developed by [[Andy Matsuchak]] that encourages a couple of different best practices:
1. Evergreen notes should be atomic
2. Evergreen notes should be concept oriented
3. Evregreen notes should be densely linked
4. Prefer associative ontologies to hierarchical taxonomies

If you're curious about what this means, I would encourage you to [read a sample of Andy's Notes firsthand](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes). But boiled down, it's a great way to categorize information so that when reviewed, it will allow for creative and educational insight. That's the gist of it.

I also use [[Obsidian]] to write.
